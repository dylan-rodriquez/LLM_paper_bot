Abstract: Multilook coherent imaging is a widely used technique in applications such as digital holography, ultrasound imaging, and synthetic aperture radar. A central challenge in these systems is the presence of multiplicative noise, commonly known as speckle, which degrades image quality. Despite the widespread use of coherent imaging systems, their theoretical foundations remain relatively underexplored. In this paper, we study both the theoretical and algorithmic aspects of likelihood-based approaches for multilook coherent imaging, providing a rigorous framework for analysis and method development. Our theoretical contributions include establishing the first theoretical upper bound on the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the maximum likelihood estimator under the deep image prior hypothesis. Our results capture the dependence of MSE on the number of parameters in the deep image prior, the number of looks, the signal dimension, and the number of measurements per look. On the algorithmic side, we employ projected gradient descent (PGD) as an efficient method for computing the maximum likelihood solution. Furthermore, we introduce two key ideas to enhance the practical performance of PGD. First, we incorporate the Newton-Schulz algorithm to compute matrix inverses within the PGD iterations, significantly reducing computational complexity. Second, we develop a bagging strategy to mitigate projection errors introduced during PGD updates. We demonstrate that combining these techniques with PGD yields state-of-the-art performance.
