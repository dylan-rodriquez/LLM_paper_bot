## Abstract

arXiv:2505.23165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the best arm identification (BAI) problem with potentially biased offline data in the fixed confidence setting, which commonly arises in real-world scenarios such as clinical trials. We prove an impossibility result for adaptive algorithms without prior knowledge of the bias bound between online and offline distributions. To address this, we propose the LUCB-H algorithm, which introduces adaptive confidence bounds by incorporating an auxiliary bias correction to balance offline and online data within the LUCB framework. Theoretical analysis shows that LUCB-H matches the sample complexity of standard LUCB when offline data is misleading and significantly outperforms it when offline data is helpful. We also derive an instance-dependent lower bound that matches the upper bound of LUCB-H in certain scenarios. Numerical experiments further demonstrate the robustness and adaptability of LUCB-H in effectively incorporating offline data.

**Justification:** This paper tackles a relevant and practical problem â€“ best arm identification with biased offline data, common in fields like clinical trials. The impossibility result is a strong theoretical contribution, and the LUCB-H algorithm appears to be a well-motivated and theoretically sound approach to address the identified limitations. The matching lower bound and empirical validation further strengthen the work, suggesting a high degree of rigor and potential for positive reception.
