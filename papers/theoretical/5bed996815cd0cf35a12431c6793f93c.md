## Abstract

arXiv:2505.22696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to continuously and efficiently transfer skills across tasks is a hallmark of biological intelligence and a long-standing goal in artificial systems. Reinforcement learning (RL), a dominant paradigm for learning in high-dimensional control tasks, is known to suffer from brittleness to task variations and catastrophic forgetting. Neuroevolution (NE) has recently gained attention for its robustness, scalability, and capacity to escape local optima. In this paper, we investigate an understudied dimension of NE: its transfer learning capabilities. To this end, we introduce two benchmarks: a) in stepping gates, neural networks are tasked with emulating logic circuits, with designs that emphasize modular repetition and variation b) ecorobot extends the Brax physics engine with objects such as walls and obstacles and the ability to easily switch between different robotic morphologies. Crucial in both benchmarks is the presence of a curriculum that enables evaluating skill transfer across tasks of increasing complexity. Our empirical analysis shows that NE methods vary in their transfer abilities and frequently outperform RL baselines. Our findings support the potential of NE as a foundation for building more adaptable agents and highlight future challenges for scaling NE to complex, real-world problems.

**Justification:** This paper addresses a crucial problem in AI â€“ the brittleness of RL and the potential of NE for transfer learning. The introduction of two new benchmarks, 'stepping gates' and 'ecorobot', is a strong methodological contribution, providing a valuable resource for the community. While NE is gaining traction, a systematic comparison with RL in transfer learning is relatively underexplored, making this work timely and relevant. The abstract suggests a rigorous investigation, though the full paper would need to be reviewed to confirm.
