## Abstract

arXiv:2505.22771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study illustrates how incorporating feedback-oriented annotations into the scoring pipeline can enhance the accuracy of automated essay scoring (AES). This approach is demonstrated with the Persuasive Essays for Rating, Selecting, and Understanding Argumentative and Discourse Elements (PERSUADE) corpus. We integrate two types of feedback-driven annotations: those that identify spelling and grammatical errors, and those that highlight argumentative components. To illustrate how this method could be applied in real-world scenarios, we employ two LLMs to generate annotations -- a generative language model used for spell-correction and an encoder-based token classifier trained to identify and mark argumentative elements. By incorporating annotations into the scoring process, we demonstrate improvements in performance using encoder-based large language models fine-tuned as classifiers.

## Analysis

**Innovation Score:** 65.0/100
**Impact Score:** 70.0/100  
**Sentiment Score:** 80.0/100

**Justification:** The paper addresses a relevant problem in educational technology â€“ improving AES. Integrating feedback annotations is a logical and potentially effective approach. While the methodology appears sound (using LLMs for annotation and fine-tuning classifiers), the abstract doesn't detail the *magnitude* of improvement, which impacts the perceived novelty. The use of the PERSUADE corpus is a good choice, and the focus on argumentative components is valuable.
