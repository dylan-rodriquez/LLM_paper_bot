## Abstract

arXiv:2505.22801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open Relation Extraction (OpenRE) seeks to identify and extract novel relational facts between named entities from unlabeled data without pre-defined relation schemas. Traditional OpenRE methods typically assume that the unlabeled data consists solely of novel relations or is pre-divided into known and novel instances. However, in real-world scenarios, novel relations are arbitrarily distributed. In this paper, we propose a generalized OpenRE setting that considers unlabeled data as a mixture of both known and novel instances. To address this, we propose MixORE, a two-phase framework that integrates relation classification and clustering to jointly learn known and novel relations. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that MixORE consistently outperforms competitive baselines in known relation classification and novel relation clustering. Our findings contribute to the advancement of generalized OpenRE research and real-world applications.

**Justification:** The paper addresses a realistic limitation of current OpenRE methods â€“ the assumption of purely novel relations. Proposing a generalized setting and a two-phase framework (MixORE) to handle mixed data is a solid contribution. The reported performance improvements on benchmark datasets suggest a well-executed methodology, though the abstract lacks detail on the specifics of the clustering and classification techniques used. The problem is relevant and the approach appears sound, indicating a positive reception within the OpenRE community.
