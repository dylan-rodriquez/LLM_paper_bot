## Abstract

arXiv:2505.23024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vision Language Model (VLM) excels in aligning vision and language representations, and prompt learning has emerged as a key technique for adapting such models to downstream tasks. However, the application of prompt learning with VLM in federated learning (\fl{}) scenarios remains underexplored. This paper systematically investigates the behavioral differences between language prompt learning (LPT) and vision prompt learning (VPT) under data heterogeneity challenges, including label skew and domain shift. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the impact of various \fl{} and prompt configurations, such as client scale, aggregation strategies, and prompt length, to assess the robustness of Federated Prompt Learning (FPL). Furthermore, we explore strategies for enhancing prompt learning in complex scenarios where label skew and domain shift coexist, including leveraging both prompt types when computational resources allow. Our findings offer practical insights into optimizing prompt learning in federated settings, contributing to the broader deployment of VLMs in privacy-preserving environments.

**Justification:** This paper addresses a relevant and growing area â€“ federated learning with Vision Language Models. The systematic investigation of prompt learning differences (LPT vs. VPT) under data heterogeneity is a strong point. While the problem is significant, the abstract doesn't suggest a radically new approach, leaning more towards empirical analysis and configuration exploration. The exploration of combining prompt types is a positive step.
