Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) see wider real-world use, understanding and mitigating their unsafe behaviors is critical. Interpretation techniques can reveal causes of unsafe outputs and guide safety, but such connections with safety are often overlooked in prior surveys. We present the first survey that bridges this gap, introducing a unified framework that connects safety-focused interpretation methods, the safety enhancements they inform, and the tools that operationalize them. Our novel taxonomy, organized by LLM workflow stages, summarizes nearly 70 works at their intersections. We conclude with open challenges and future directions. This timely survey helps researchers and practitioners navigate key advancements for safer, more interpretable LLMs.

## Analysis

**Innovation Score:** 75.0/100
**Impact Score:** 88.0/100  
**Sentiment Score:** 90.0/100

**Justification:** This survey addresses a highly relevant and timely problem – LLM safety – and uniquely focuses on the intersection of interpretation techniques and safety enhancements. The creation of a unified framework and novel taxonomy is a strong methodological contribution. While surveys are generally incremental, bridging this gap in existing literature is valuable, and the scope of nearly 70 works suggests a comprehensive effort.
