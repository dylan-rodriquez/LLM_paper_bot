## Abstract

arXiv:2505.22798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing reliance on artificial intelligence in safety- and security-critical applications demands effective neural network certification. A challenging real-world use case is certification against ``patch attacks'', where adversarial patches or lighting conditions obscure parts of images, for example traffic signs. One approach to certification, which also gives quantitative coverage estimates, utilizes preimages of neural networks, i.e., the set of inputs that lead to a specified output. However, these preimage approximation methods, including the state-of-the-art PREMAP algorithm, struggle with scalability. This paper presents novel algorithmic improvements to PREMAP involving tighter bounds, adaptive Monte Carlo sampling, and improved branching heuristics. We demonstrate efficiency improvements of at least an order of magnitude on reinforcement learning control benchmarks, and show that our method scales to convolutional neural networks that were previously infeasible. Our results demonstrate the potential of preimage approximation methodology for reliability and robustness certification.

**Justification:** The paper addresses a crucial problem in AI safety â€“ neural network certification against adversarial attacks, specifically patch attacks. Improving the scalability of preimage approximation methods like PREMAP is a significant step forward, and the reported order of magnitude efficiency gains are promising. While the improvements appear incremental (tighter bounds, adaptive sampling, improved heuristics), they are applied to a relevant and challenging problem, suggesting a positive reception within the community. The focus on reinforcement learning control benchmarks also adds to its practical relevance.
