## Abstract

arXiv:2505.23116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series forecasting with exogenous variables is a critical emerging paradigm that presents unique challenges in modeling dependencies between variables. Traditional models often struggle to differentiate between endogenous and exogenous variables, leading to inefficiencies and overfitting. In this paper, we introduce CrossLinear, a novel Linear-based forecasting model that addresses these challenges by incorporating a plug-and-play cross-correlation embedding module. This lightweight module captures the dependencies between variables with minimal computational cost and seamlessly integrates into existing neural networks. Specifically, it captures time-invariant and direct variable dependencies while disregarding time-varying or indirect dependencies, thereby mitigating the risk of overfitting in dependency modeling and contributing to consistent performance improvements. Furthermore, CrossLinear employs patch-wise processing and a global linear head to effectively capture both short-term and long-term temporal dependencies, further improving its forecasting precision. Extensive experiments on 12 real-world datasets demonstrate that CrossLinear achieves superior performance in both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks. The ablation study underscores the effectiveness of the cross-correlation embedding module. Additionally, the generalizability of this module makes it a valuable plug-in for various forecasting tasks across different domains.

**Justification:** The paper addresses a relevant problem in time series forecasting – handling exogenous variables – and proposes a novel approach (CrossLinear) that aims to improve performance and prevent overfitting. The 'plug-and-play' aspect and focus on direct dependencies are promising. While the abstract suggests a solid methodology, the full paper will need to demonstrate rigorous evaluation and comparison to existing methods to fully validate its claims. The focus on linear-based forecasting in a field increasingly dominated by neural networks is a slightly unusual choice, but the efficiency argument is compelling.
