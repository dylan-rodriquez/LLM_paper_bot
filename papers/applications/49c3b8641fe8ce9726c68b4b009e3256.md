## Abstract

arXiv:2506.05635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremist groups develop complex in-group language, also referred to as cryptolects, to exclude or mislead outsiders. We investigate the ability of current language technologies to detect and interpret the cryptolects of two online extremist platforms. Evaluating eight models across six tasks, our results indicate that general purpose LLMs cannot consistently detect or decode extremist language. However, performance can be significantly improved by domain adaptation and specialised prompting techniques. These results provide important insights to inform the development and deployment of automated moderation technologies. We further develop and release novel labelled and unlabelled datasets, including 19.4M posts from extremist platforms and lexicons validated by human experts.

## Analysis

**Innovation Score:** 65.0/100
**Impact Score:** 88.0/100  
**Sentiment Score:** 85.0/100

**Justification:** This research tackles a highly relevant and important problem â€“ understanding extremist communication. The finding that general LLMs struggle with this task, but can be improved with adaptation, is valuable. The release of datasets is a significant contribution to the field, and the work appears methodologically sound based on the abstract. The innovation is moderate, building on existing LLM techniques rather than presenting entirely new architectures.
