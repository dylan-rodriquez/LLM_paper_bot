## Abstract

arXiv:2505.22758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The size and compute characteristics of modern large language models have led to an increased interest in developing specialized kernels tailored for training and inference. Existing kernels primarily optimize for compute utilization, targeting the large-batch training and inference settings. However, low-batch inference, where memory bandwidth and kernel launch overheads contribute are significant factors, remains important for many applications of interest such as in edge deployment and latency-sensitive applications. This paper describes FlashFormer, a proof-of-concept kernel for accelerating single-batch inference for transformer-based large language models. Across various model sizes and quantizations settings, we observe nontrivial speedups compared to existing state-of-the-art inference kernels.

## Analysis

**Innovation Score:** 70.0/100
**Impact Score:** 75.0/100  
**Sentiment Score:** 85.0/100

**Justification:** The paper addresses a crucial bottleneck in LLM deployment â€“ efficient low-batch inference. Focusing on memory bandwidth and kernel launch overheads is a smart move, given the increasing demand for edge deployment and latency-sensitive applications. While described as a 'proof-of-concept,' the observed speedups suggest a promising direction, and the clear problem statement and focus contribute to a strong initial presentation. The field is actively seeking inference optimizations, so positive reception is likely.
