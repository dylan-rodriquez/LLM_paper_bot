## Abstract

arXiv:2505.22861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tasks that involve complex interactions between objects with unknown dynamics make planning before execution difficult. These tasks require agents to iteratively improve their actions after actively exploring causes and effects in the environment. For these type of tasks, we propose Causal-PIK, a method that leverages Bayesian optimization to reason about causal interactions via a Physics-Informed Kernel to help guide efficient search for the best next action. Experimental results on Virtual Tools and PHYRE physical reasoning benchmarks show that Causal-PIK outperforms state-of-the-art results, requiring fewer actions to reach the goal. We also compare Causal-PIK to human studies, including results from a new user study we conducted on the PHYRE benchmark. We find that Causal-PIK remains competitive on tasks that are very challenging, even for human problem-solvers.

**Justification:** The paper addresses a challenging problem in physical reasoning and planning, particularly in scenarios with unknown dynamics. Leveraging Bayesian optimization with a Physics-Informed Kernel appears to be a novel and effective approach, as evidenced by the outperformance on benchmark tasks and competitive results against human performance. The inclusion of a new user study strengthens the evaluation, suggesting a rigorous methodology and clear presentation of results.
