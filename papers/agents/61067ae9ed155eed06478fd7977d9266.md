## Abstract

arXiv:2505.22846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactive Theorem Proving was repeatedly shown to be fruitful combined with Generative Artificial Intelligence. This paper assesses multiple approaches to Rocq generation and illuminates potential avenues for improvement. We highlight the importance of thorough premise selection for generating Rocq proofs and propose a novel approach, leveraging retrieval via a self-attentive embedder model. The evaluation of the designed approach shows up to 28% relative increase of the generator's performance. We tackle the problem of writing Rocq proofs using a multi-stage agentic system, tailored for formal verification, and demonstrate its high effectiveness. We conduct an ablation study and show the use of multi-agent debate on the planning stage of proof synthesis.

## Analysis

**Innovation Score:** 72.0/100
**Impact Score:** 75.0/100  
**Sentiment Score:** 85.0/100

**Justification:** The paper addresses a relevant problem in the intersection of AI and formal verification, which is gaining traction. The reported 28% performance increase is promising, and the use of a multi-stage agentic system and multi-agent debate suggests a thoughtful approach. While the abstract doesn't detail the specifics of the self-attentive embedder or the agentic system, the combination of retrieval and agent-based methods appears novel and well-motivated. The ablation study indicates a rigorous evaluation.
