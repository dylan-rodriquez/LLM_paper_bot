## Abstract

arXiv:2505.23055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical decision-making is inherently complex and fast-paced, particularly in emergency departments (EDs) where critical, rapid and high-stakes decisions are made. Clinical Decision Rules (CDRs) are standardized evidence-based tools that combine signs, symptoms, and clinical variables into decision trees to make consistent and accurate diagnoses. CDR usage is often hindered by the clinician's cognitive load, limiting their ability to quickly recall and apply the appropriate rules. We introduce CDR-Agent, a novel LLM-based system designed to enhance ED decision-making by autonomously identifying and applying the most appropriate CDRs based on unstructured clinical notes. To validate CDR-Agent, we curated two novel ED datasets: synthetic and CDR-Bench, although CDR-Agent is applicable to non ED clinics. CDR-Agent achieves a 56.3\% (synthetic) and 8.7\% (CDR-Bench) accuracy gain relative to the standalone LLM baseline in CDR selection. Moreover, CDR-Agent significantly reduces computational overhead. Using these datasets, we demonstrated that CDR-Agent not only selects relevant CDRs efficiently, but makes cautious yet effective imaging decisions by minimizing unnecessary interventions while successfully identifying most positively diagnosed cases, outperforming traditional LLM prompting approaches.

## Analysis

**Innovation Score:** 72.0/100
**Impact Score:** 80.0/100  
**Sentiment Score:** 88.0/100

**Justification:** This paper addresses a crucial problem in healthcare â€“ reducing cognitive load on clinicians in fast-paced environments like EDs. The use of LLM agents to autonomously select and apply CDRs is a promising approach, and the reported accuracy gains are encouraging. While the methodology appears sound based on the abstract, the reliance on synthetic data alongside a new benchmark (CDR-Bench) warrants further scrutiny upon full paper review. The potential for improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency is significant.
