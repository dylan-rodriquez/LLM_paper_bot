## Abstract

arXiv:2505.23185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Message-Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) have become a cornerstone for processing and analyzing graph-structured data. However, their effectiveness is often hindered by phenomena such as over-squashing, where long-range dependencies or interactions are inadequately captured and expressed in the MPNN output. This limitation mirrors the challenges of the Effective Receptive Field (ERF) in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), where the theoretical receptive field is underutilized in practice. In this work, we show and theoretically explain the limited ERF problem in MPNNs. Furthermore, inspired by recent advances in ERF augmentation for CNNs, we propose an Interleaved Multiscale Message-Passing Neural Networks (IM-MPNN) architecture to address these problems in MPNNs. Our method incorporates a hierarchical coarsening of the graph, enabling message-passing across multiscale representations and facilitating long-range interactions without excessive depth or parameterization. Through extensive evaluations on benchmarks such as the Long-Range Graph Benchmark (LRGB), we demonstrate substantial improvements over baseline MPNNs in capturing long-range dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency.

**Justification:** The paper addresses a well-known limitation of MPNNs – the effective receptive field – and draws a compelling parallel to CNNs. The proposed IM-MPNN architecture, inspired by ERF augmentation techniques in CNNs, appears to be a reasonable approach to tackling this issue. While the abstract doesn't detail the specifics of the theoretical explanation, the combination of theoretical analysis and a novel architecture suggests solid research. The problem is significant, and the approach has potential, but the actual results and experimental validation will be crucial.
