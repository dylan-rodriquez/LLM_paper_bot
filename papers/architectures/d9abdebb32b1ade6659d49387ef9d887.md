## Abstract

arXiv:2505.23086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SE(3)-equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significantly advanced molecular system modeling by employing group representations. However, their message passing processes, which rely on tensor product-based convolutions, are limited by insufficient non-linearity and incomplete group representations, thereby restricting expressiveness. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Equivariant Spherical Transformer (EST), a novel framework that leverages a Transformer structure within the spatial domain of group representations after Fourier transform. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that EST can encompass the function space of tensor products while achieving superior expressiveness. Furthermore, EST's equivariant inductive bias is guaranteed through a uniform sampling strategy for the Fourier transform. Our experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance by EST on various molecular benchmarks, including OC20 and QM9.

**Justification:** This paper addresses a crucial limitation in equivariant GNNs for molecular modeling – expressiveness – by introducing the Equivariant Spherical Transformer. The use of Fourier transforms and a Transformer architecture within the group representation domain appears novel and theoretically sound. The claim of state-of-the-art performance on molecular benchmarks further strengthens its potential, suggesting a well-executed and impactful contribution to the field.
