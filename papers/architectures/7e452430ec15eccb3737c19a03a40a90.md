## Abstract

arXiv:2505.24187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prevailing assumption of an exponential decay in large language model (LLM) reliability with sequence length, predicated on independent per-token error probabilities, posits an inherent limitation for long autoregressive outputs. Our research fundamentally challenges this view by synthesizing emerging evidence that LLM errors are not uniformly distributed but are concentrated at sparse "key tokens" ($5-10\%$ of total tokens) representing critical decision junctions. By distinguishing these high-impact tokens from the increasingly predictable majority, we introduce a new reliability formula explaining the sustained coherence of modern LLMs over thousands of tokens. Converging research streams reveal that long-context performance primarily depends on accurately navigating a few crucial semantic decision points rather than on uniform token-level accuracy, enabling targeted strategies that significantly outperform brute-force approaches. We thus propose a framework for next-generation systems centered on selective preservation of semantically vital tokens, dynamic computational allocation at uncertain decision boundaries, multi-path exploration at ambiguities, and architectures aligned with natural semantic domains. This marks a fundamental shift from raw scaling to strategic reasoning, promising breakthrough performance without proportionate computational scaling and offering a more nuanced understanding that supersedes the exponential decay hypothesis, thereby opening pathways toward substantially more powerful and efficient language systems.

**Justification:** This paper tackles a crucial problem in LLM research – the limitations of sequence length – and proposes a compelling alternative to the standard exponential decay model. The identification of 'key tokens' as the primary drivers of error is a novel and potentially impactful insight. The abstract suggests a rigorous approach with converging evidence, and the potential for targeted strategies to improve long-context performance is highly promising.
