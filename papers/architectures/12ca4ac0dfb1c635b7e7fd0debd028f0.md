## Abstract

arXiv:2505.23797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suicidal thoughts and behaviors are increasingly recognized as a critical societal concern, highlighting the urgent need for effective tools to enable early detection of suicidal risk. In this work, we develop robust machine learning models that leverage Reddit posts to automatically classify them into four distinct levels of suicide risk severity. We frame this as a multi-class classification task and propose a RoBERTa-TF-IDF-PCA Hybrid model, integrating the deep contextual embeddings from Robustly Optimized BERT Approach (RoBERTa), a state-of-the-art deep learning transformer model, with the statistical term-weighting of TF-IDF, further compressed with PCA, to boost the accuracy and reliability of suicide risk assessment. To address data imbalance and overfitting, we explore various data resampling techniques and data augmentation strategies to enhance model generalization. Additionally, we compare our model's performance against that of using RoBERTa only, the BERT model and other traditional machine learning classifiers. Experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid model can achieve improved performance, giving a best weighted $F_{1}$ score of 0.7512.

**Justification:** This research tackles a highly significant problem – suicidal risk detection – with a potentially useful hybrid approach. The combination of RoBERTa, TF-IDF, and PCA is a reasonable strategy to address the challenges of imbalanced data and improve model performance. While the hybrid model isn't radically new, the application to this specific problem and the focus on data resampling/augmentation techniques demonstrate a solid methodological approach. The potential for real-world impact is high, given the societal need for early detection tools.
