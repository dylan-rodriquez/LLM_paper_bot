## Abstract

arXiv:2505.24119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the linguistic diversity of LLM safety research, highlighting the English-centric nature of the field. Through a systematic review of nearly 300 publications from 2020--2024 across major NLP conferences and workshops at *ACL, we identify a significant and growing language gap in LLM safety research, with even high-resource non-English languages receiving minimal attention. We further observe that non-English languages are rarely studied as a standalone language and that English safety research exhibits poor language documentation practice. To motivate future research into multilingual safety, we make several recommendations based on our survey, and we then pose three concrete future directions on safety evaluation, training data generation, and crosslingual safety generalization. Based on our survey and proposed directions, the field can develop more robust, inclusive AI safety practices for diverse global populations.

## Analysis

**Innovation Score:** 65.0/100
**Impact Score:** 85.0/100  
**Sentiment Score:** 88.0/100

**Justification:** This paper addresses a crucial and timely issue in LLM safety â€“ the significant bias towards English language research. The systematic review methodology appears sound, and the identification of a language gap is a valuable contribution. While the paper primarily *highlights* a problem rather than presenting novel solutions, the proposed future directions are well-considered and likely to stimulate further research. The high relevance to current AI safety concerns suggests a positive reception within the community.
