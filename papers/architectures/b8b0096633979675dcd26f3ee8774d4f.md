## Abstract

arXiv:2505.22813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the universal quest to optimize machine-learning classifiers, three factors -- model architecture, dataset size, and class balance -- have been shown to influence test-time performance but do not fully account for it. Previously, evidence was presented for an additional factor that can be referred to as dataset quality, but it was unclear whether this was actually a joint property of the dataset and the model architecture, or an intrinsic property of the dataset itself. If quality is truly dataset-intrinsic and independent of model architecture, dataset size, and class balance, then the same datasets should perform better (or worse) regardless of these other factors. To test this hypothesis, here we create thousands of datasets, each controlled for size and class balance, and use them to train classifiers with a wide range of architectures, from random forests and support-vector machines to deep networks. We find that classifier performance correlates strongly by subset across architectures ($R^2=0.79$), supporting quality as an intrinsic property of datasets independent of dataset size and class balance and of model architecture. Digging deeper, we find that dataset quality appears to be an emergent property of something more fundamental: the quality of datasets' constituent classes. Thus, quality joins size, class balance, and model architecture as an independent correlate of performance and a separate target for optimizing machine-learning-based classification.

**Justification:** The paper addresses a crucial question in machine learning â€“ understanding the source of performance variation beyond typical factors. The experimental design, involving the creation of thousands of controlled datasets and training diverse models, appears rigorous. Establishing dataset quality as an intrinsic property would be a significant finding, potentially shifting focus in dataset creation and evaluation. The abstract suggests a well-defined hypothesis and a systematic approach to testing it.
