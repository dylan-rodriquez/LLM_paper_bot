## Abstract

arXiv:2505.23190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel neural network approach, termed DeepRTE, to address the steady-state Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE). The RTE is a differential-integral equation that governs the propagation of radiation through a participating medium, with applications spanning diverse domains such as neutron transport, atmospheric radiative transfer, heat transfer, and optical imaging. Our proposed DeepRTE framework leverages pre-trained attention-based neural networks to solve the RTE with high accuracy and computational efficiency. The efficacy of the proposed approach is substantiated through comprehensive numerical experiments.

## Analysis

**Innovation Score:** 72.0/100
**Impact Score:** 80.0/100  
**Sentiment Score:** 75.0/100

**Justification:** The paper addresses a computationally challenging problem (RTE) with a potentially impactful approach (pre-trained attention-based networks). The use of pre-training suggests an attempt to leverage existing knowledge and improve efficiency, which is a positive sign. While the abstract is concise, it lacks specific details about the network architecture or experimental results, making a definitive assessment difficult, but the problem domain is well-established and important. The stated applications are broad and suggest significant potential.
