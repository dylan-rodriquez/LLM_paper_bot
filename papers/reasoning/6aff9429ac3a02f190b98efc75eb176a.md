## Abstract

arXiv:2506.03408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in integrating language-driven techniques into trajectory prediction. By leveraging their semantic and reasoning capabilities, LLMs are reshaping how autonomous systems perceive, model, and predict trajectories. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of this emerging field, categorizing recent work into five directions: (1) Trajectory prediction via language modeling paradigms, (2) Direct trajectory prediction with pretrained language models, (3) Language-guided scene understanding for trajectory prediction, (4) Language-driven data generation for trajectory prediction, (5) Language-based reasoning and interpretability for trajectory prediction. For each, we analyze representative methods, highlight core design choices, and identify open challenges. This survey bridges natural language processing and trajectory prediction, offering a unified perspective on how language can enrich trajectory prediction.

## Analysis

**Innovation Score:** 75.0/100
**Impact Score:** 88.0/100  
**Sentiment Score:** 90.0/100

**Justification:** This survey paper addresses a highly relevant and timely intersection of LLMs and trajectory prediction, a crucial area for autonomous systems. The categorization into five distinct directions provides a structured and comprehensive overview of the field. While surveys are inherently less 'innovative' than novel methods, this one appears well-organized and likely to be a valuable resource for researchers entering the field, suggesting a strong positive reception.
