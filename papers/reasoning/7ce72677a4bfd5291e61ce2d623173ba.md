## Abstract

arXiv:2506.06842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disinformation detection is a key aspect of media literacy. Psychological studies have shown that knowledge of persuasive fallacies helps individuals detect disinformation. Inspired by these findings, we experimented with large language models (LLMs) to test whether infusing persuasion knowledge enhances disinformation detection. As a result, we introduce the Persuasion-Augmented Chain of Thought (PCoT), a novel approach that leverages persuasion to improve disinformation detection in zero-shot classification. We extensively evaluate PCoT on online news and social media posts. Moreover, we publish two novel, up-to-date disinformation datasets: EUDisinfo and MultiDis. These datasets enable the evaluation of PCoT on content entirely unseen by the LLMs used in our experiments, as the content was published after the models' knowledge cutoffs. We show that, on average, PCoT outperforms competitive methods by 15% across five LLMs and five datasets. These findings highlight the value of persuasion in strengthening zero-shot disinformation detection.

**Justification:** This paper addresses a highly significant problem – disinformation detection – and proposes a novel approach (PCoT) grounded in psychological principles. The creation and release of two new, up-to-date datasets (EUDisinfo and MultiDis) is a substantial contribution, particularly given the rapidly evolving nature of online disinformation. While the core idea of leveraging persuasion knowledge is promising, the 15% performance improvement, while notable, needs further scrutiny in the full paper to assess its statistical significance and robustness.
