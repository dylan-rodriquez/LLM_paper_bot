## Abstract

arXiv:2505.23788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) commonly risk copyright infringement by reproducing protected content verbatim or with insufficient transformative modifications, posing significant ethical, legal, and practical concerns. Current inference-time safeguards predominantly rely on restrictive refusal-based filters, often compromising the practical utility of these models. To address this, we collaborated closely with intellectual property experts to develop FUA-LLM (Fair Use Aligned Language Models), a legally-grounded framework explicitly designed to align LLM outputs with fair-use doctrine. Central to our method is FairUseDB, a carefully constructed dataset containing 18,000 expert-validated examples covering nine realistic infringement scenarios. Leveraging this dataset, we apply Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to fine-tune open-source LLMs, encouraging them to produce legally compliant and practically useful alternatives rather than resorting to blunt refusal. Recognizing the shortcomings of traditional evaluation metrics, we propose new measures: Weighted Penalty Utility and Compliance Aware Harmonic Mean (CAH) to balance infringement risk against response utility. Extensive quantitative experiments coupled with expert evaluations confirm that FUA-LLM substantially reduces problematic outputs (up to 20\%) compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while preserving real-world usability.

## Analysis

**Innovation Score:** 75.0/100
**Impact Score:** 88.0/100  
**Sentiment Score:** 85.0/100

**Justification:** This paper tackles a crucial and timely problem – copyright infringement in LLMs – with a practical and legally-informed approach. The creation of FairUseDB and the application of DPO for alignment are strong methodological choices. While DPO isn't novel in itself, its application to this specific legal constraint is a valuable contribution, and the collaboration with IP experts adds significant weight to the work. The focus on *avoiding* infringement rather than simply filtering outputs is a promising direction.
