Abstract: Large Language Model agents have begun to appear as personal assistants, customer service bots, and clinical aides. While these applications deliver substantial operational benefits, they also require continuous access to sensitive data, which increases the likelihood of unauthorized disclosures. This study proposes an auditing framework for conversational privacy that quantifies and audits these risks. The proposed Conversational Manipulation for Privacy Leakage (CMPL) framework, is an iterative probing strategy designed to stress-test agents that enforce strict privacy directives. Rather than focusing solely on a single disclosure event, CMPL simulates realistic multi-turn interactions to systematically uncover latent vulnerabilities. Our evaluation on diverse domains, data modalities, and safety configurations demonstrate the auditing framework's ability to reveal privacy risks that are not deterred by existing single-turn defenses. In addition to introducing CMPL as a diagnostic tool, the paper delivers (1) an auditing procedure grounded in quantifiable risk metrics and (2) an open benchmark for evaluation of conversational privacy across agent implementations.

**Impact Score:** 85.0/100  
**Sentiment Score:** 88.0/100

**Justification:** This paper addresses a highly relevant and timely problem â€“ the privacy risks associated with increasingly capable LLM agents. The proposed CMPL framework appears well-motivated and designed to overcome limitations of single-turn auditing methods. The focus on multi-turn interactions and systematic vulnerability uncovering is a strong point, suggesting a rigorous approach. The potential for revealing risks not caught by existing defenses is significant, indicating a positive reception within the community.
