## Abstract

arXiv:2505.22967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the promise of autonomous agentic reasoning, existing workflow generation methods frequently produce fragile, unexecutable plans due to unconstrained LLM-driven construction. We introduce MermaidFlow, a framework that redefines the agentic search space through safety-constrained graph evolution. At its core, MermaidFlow represent workflows as a verifiable intermediate representation using Mermaid, a structured and human-interpretable graph language. We formulate domain-aware evolutionary operators, i.e., crossover, mutation, insertion, and deletion, to preserve semantic correctness while promoting structural diversity, enabling efficient exploration of a high-quality, statically verifiable workflow space. Without modifying task settings or evaluation protocols, MermaidFlow achieves consistent improvements in success rates and faster convergence to executable plans on the agent reasoning benchmark. The experimental results demonstrate that safety-constrained graph evolution offers a scalable, modular foundation for robust and interpretable agentic reasoning systems.

**Sentiment Score:** 80.0/100

**Justification:** This paper addresses a crucial problem in agentic workflows â€“ the fragility of plans generated by LLMs. The use of Mermaid for a verifiable intermediate representation and the application of evolutionary programming with safety constraints are promising approaches. The claim of consistent improvements without modifying task settings suggests a robust and generalizable method, though further details on the benchmark and results are needed to fully assess the magnitude of the improvements.
