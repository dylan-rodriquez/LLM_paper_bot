## Abstract

arXiv:2506.04079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report presents EuroLLM-9B, a large language model trained from scratch to support the needs of European citizens by covering all 24 official European Union languages and 11 additional languages. EuroLLM addresses the issue of European languages being underrepresented and underserved in existing open large language models. We provide a comprehensive overview of EuroLLM-9B's development, including tokenizer design, architectural specifications, data filtering, and training procedures. We describe the pre-training data collection and filtering pipeline, including the creation of EuroFilter, an AI-based multilingual filter, as well as the design of EuroBlocks-Synthetic, a novel synthetic dataset for post-training that enhances language coverage for European languages. Evaluation results demonstrate EuroLLM-9B's competitive performance on multilingual benchmarks and machine translation tasks, establishing it as the leading open European-made LLM of its size. To support open research and adoption, we release all major components of this work, including the base and instruction-tuned models, the EuroFilter classifier, and the synthetic post-training dataset.

## Analysis

**Innovation Score:** 75.0/100
**Impact Score:** 88.0/100  
**Sentiment Score:** 90.0/100

**Justification:** This paper addresses a crucial gap in the LLM landscape â€“ the underrepresentation of European languages. The development of EuroFilter and EuroBlocks-Synthetic demonstrates a thoughtful approach to data curation and augmentation, and the reported competitive performance suggests a well-executed project. The focus on open access is also a significant positive, fostering wider research and application.
