## Abstract

arXiv:2506.09108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present SensorLM, a family of sensor-language foundation models that enable wearable sensor data understanding with natural language. Despite its pervasive nature, aligning and interpreting sensor data with language remains challenging due to the lack of paired, richly annotated sensor-text descriptions in uncurated, real-world wearable data. We introduce a hierarchical caption generation pipeline designed to capture statistical, structural, and semantic information from sensor data. This approach enabled the curation of the largest sensor-language dataset to date, comprising over 59.7 million hours of data from more than 103,000 people. Furthermore, SensorLM extends prominent multimodal pretraining architectures (e.g., CLIP, CoCa) and recovers them as specific variants within a generic architecture. Extensive experiments on real-world tasks in human activity analysis and healthcare verify the superior performance of SensorLM over state-of-the-art in zero-shot recognition, few-shot learning, and cross-modal retrieval. SensorLM also demonstrates intriguing capabilities including scaling behaviors, label efficiency, sensor captioning, and zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks.

**Justification:** This paper addresses a crucial problem in wearable sensor data analysis â€“ bridging the gap between raw sensor signals and natural language understanding. The creation of a large, annotated dataset (59.7 million hours!) is a significant achievement, and extending existing multimodal architectures demonstrates a thoughtful approach. The reported superior performance on real-world tasks suggests strong potential, and the work aligns well with current trends in foundation models and multimodal learning.
