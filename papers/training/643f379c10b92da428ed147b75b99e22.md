## Abstract

arXiv:2506.05073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-harm detection on social media is critical for early intervention and mental health support, yet remains challenging due to the subtle, context-dependent nature of such expressions. Identifying self-harm intent aids suicide prevention by enabling timely responses, but current large language models (LLMs) struggle to interpret implicit cues in casual language and emojis. This work enhances LLMs' comprehension of self-harm by distinguishing intent through nuanced language-emoji interplay. We present the Centennial Emoji Sensitivity Matrix (CESM-100), a curated set of 100 emojis with contextual self-harm interpretations and the Self-Harm Identification aNd intent Extraction with Supportive emoji sensitivity (SHINES) dataset, offering detailed annotations for self-harm labels, casual mentions (CMs), and serious intents (SIs). Our unified framework: a) enriches inputs using CESM-100; b) fine-tunes LLMs for multi-task learning: self-harm detection (primary) and CM/SI span detection (auxiliary); c) generates explainable rationales for self-harm predictions. We evaluate the framework on three state-of-the-art LLMs-Llama 3, Mental-Alpaca, and MentalLlama, across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned scenarios. By coupling intent differentiation with contextual cues, our approach commendably enhances LLM performance in both detection and explanation tasks, effectively addressing the inherent ambiguity in self-harm signals. The SHINES dataset, CESM-100 and codebase are publicly available at: https://www.iitp.ac.in/~ai-nlp-ml/resources.html#SHINES .

**Innovation Score:** 75.0/100
**Impact Score:** 88.0/100  
**Sentiment Score:** 85.0/100

**Justification:** This research tackles a critically important problem – self-harm detection – with a novel approach focusing on emoji interpretation and intent differentiation. The creation of the CESM-100 and SHINES datasets are valuable contributions to the field, and the multi-task learning framework appears well-reasoned. While the abstract doesn't detail the specific LLM architectures used or performance gains, the overall approach seems promising and well-suited to address the challenges of subtle self-harm expressions.
