## Abstract

arXiv:2505.23048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory data is crucial for various applications but often suffers from incompleteness due to device limitations and diverse collection scenarios. Existing imputation methods rely on sparse trajectory or travel information, such as velocity, to infer missing points. However, these approaches assume that sparse trajectories retain essential behavioral patterns, which place significant demands on data acquisition and overlook the potential of large-scale human trajectory embeddings. To address this, we propose ProDiff, a trajectory imputation framework that uses only two endpoints as minimal information. It integrates prototype learning to embed human movement patterns and a denoising diffusion probabilistic model for robust spatiotemporal reconstruction. Joint training with a tailored loss function ensures effective imputation. ProDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving accuracy by 6.28\% on FourSquare and 2.52\% on WuXi. Further analysis shows a 0.927 correlation between generated and real trajectories, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

**Sentiment Score:** 85.0/100

**Justification:** The paper addresses a practical problem – incomplete trajectory data – with a novel approach leveraging diffusion models and prototype learning. The reported performance improvements on Foursquare and WuXi datasets suggest a solid methodology. While diffusion models are becoming more common, applying them to trajectory imputation with minimal input information is a noteworthy contribution, and the tailored loss function adds to the rigor. The abstract is clear and concise, indicating a well-structured paper.
