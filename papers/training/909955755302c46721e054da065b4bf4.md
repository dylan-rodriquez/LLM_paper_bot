## Abstract

arXiv:2505.23337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industry-grade ML models are carefully designed to meet rapidly evolving serving constraints, which requires significant resources for model development. In this paper, we propose MatTA, a framework for training multiple accurate Student models using a novel Teacher-TA-Student recipe. TA models are larger versions of the Student models with higher capacity, and thus allow Student models to better relate to the Teacher model and also bring in more domain-specific expertise. Furthermore, multiple accurate Student models can be extracted from the TA model. Therefore, despite only one training run, our methodology provides multiple servable options to trade off accuracy for lower serving cost. We demonstrate the proposed method, MatTA, on proprietary datasets and models. Its practical efficacy is underscored by live A/B tests within a production ML system, demonstrating 20% improvement on a key metric. We also demonstrate our method on GPT-2 Medium, a public model, and achieve relative improvements of over 24% on SAT Math and over 10% on the LAMBADA benchmark.

**Impact Score:** 88.0/100  
**Sentiment Score:** 80.0/100

**Justification:** The paper addresses a very practical problem in ML deployment â€“ balancing accuracy and serving cost. The 'MatTA' framework with the Teacher-TA-Student approach seems well-motivated and the reported 20% improvement in a live A/B test is compelling. While the core idea isn't entirely novel (knowledge distillation is well-established), the specific TA model approach and the ability to generate multiple model options from a single training run is a valuable contribution. The use of proprietary datasets is a slight drawback for reproducibility, but the GPT-2 demonstration helps.
