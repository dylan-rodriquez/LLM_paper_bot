## Abstract

arXiv:2505.23027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The subpopulationtion shift, characterized by a disparity in subpopulation distributibetween theween the training and target datasets, can significantly degrade the performance of machine learning models. Current solutions to subpopulation shift involve modifying empirical risk minimization with re-weighting strategies to improve generalization. This strategy relies on assumptions about the number and nature of subpopulations and annotations on group membership, which are unavailable for many real-world datasets. Instead, we propose using an ensemble of diverse classifiers to adaptively capture risk associated with subpopulations. Given a feature extractor network, we replace its standard linear classification layer with a mixture of prototypical classifiers, where each member is trained to classify the data while focusing on different features and samples from other members. In empirical evaluation on nine real-world datasets, covering diverse domains and kinds of subpopulation shift, our method of Diverse Prototypical Ensembles (DPEs) often outperforms the prior state-of-the-art in worst-group accuracy.

**Justification:** The paper addresses a significant problem – subpopulation shift – which is common in real-world machine learning applications. The proposed approach of using diverse prototypical ensembles is a reasonable and potentially effective alternative to re-weighting strategies, especially when group membership information is unavailable. The empirical evaluation on nine datasets suggests a solid methodology, though the abstract doesn't detail the extent of improvement over existing methods. The work appears well-aligned with current research trends in robust machine learning.
