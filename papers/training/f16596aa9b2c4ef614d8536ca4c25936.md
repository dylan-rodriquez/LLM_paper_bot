## Abstract

arXiv:2506.06877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Outcome-rewarded Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in mathematical problem-solving. However, this success often masks a critical issue: models frequently achieve correct answers through fundamentally unsound reasoning processes, a phenomenon indicative of reward hacking. We introduce MathOlympiadEval, a new dataset with fine-grained annotations, which reveals a significant gap between LLMs' answer correctness and their low process correctness. Existing automated methods like LLM-as-a-judge struggle to reliably detect these reasoning flaws. To address this, we propose ParaStepVerifier, a novel methodology for meticulous, step-by-step verification of mathematical solutions. ParaStepVerifier identifies incorrect reasoning steps. Empirical results demonstrate that ParaStepVerifier substantially improves the accuracy of identifying flawed solutions compared to baselines, especially for complex, multi-step problems. This offers a more robust path towards evaluating and training LLMs with genuine mathematical reasoning.

**Impact Score:** 80.0/100  
**Sentiment Score:** 88.0/100

**Justification:** This paper tackles a crucial problem in LLM development â€“ the disconnect between correct answers and sound reasoning. The introduction of MathOlympiadEval and ParaStepVerifier appears to be a strong methodological contribution, addressing the limitations of existing evaluation techniques. The focus on step-by-step verification is particularly valuable, and the initial results suggest a significant improvement in identifying flawed reasoning, making it likely to be well-received by the community.
