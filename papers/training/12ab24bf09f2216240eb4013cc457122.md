## Abstract

arXiv:2505.22757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-token prediction (MTP) is a recently proposed pre-training objective for language models. Rather than predicting only the next token (NTP), MTP predicts the next $k$ tokens at each prediction step, using multiple prediction heads. MTP has shown promise in improving downstream performance, inference speed, and training efficiency, particularly for large models. However, prior work has shown that smaller language models (SLMs) struggle with the MTP objective. To address this, we propose a curriculum learning strategy for MTP training, exploring two variants: a forward curriculum, which gradually increases the complexity of the pre-training objective from NTP to MTP, and a reverse curriculum, which does the opposite. Our experiments show that the forward curriculum enables SLMs to better leverage the MTP objective during pre-training, improving downstream NTP performance and generative output quality, while retaining the benefits of self-speculative decoding. The reverse curriculum achieves stronger NTP performance and output quality, but fails to provide any self-speculative decoding benefits.

**Justification:** The paper addresses a relevant problem – the difficulty SLMs have with MTP – and proposes a reasonable solution using curriculum learning. The exploration of both forward and reverse curricula is a good approach. While MTP is a relatively new area, the work appears solid and well-motivated, though the level of novelty isn't groundbreaking. The potential to improve SLM performance with MTP is valuable, especially given the resource constraints often associated with smaller models.
