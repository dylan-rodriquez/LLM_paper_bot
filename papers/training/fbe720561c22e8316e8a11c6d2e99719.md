## Abstract

arXiv:2505.23347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of live streaming services, Crowdsourced Cloud-edge service Platforms (CCPs) are playing an increasingly important role in meeting the increasing demand. Although stream scheduling plays a critical role in optimizing CCPs' revenue, most optimization strategies struggle to achieve practical results due to various anomalies in unstable CCPs. Additionally, the substantial scale of CCPs magnifies the difficulties of anomaly detection in time-sensitive scheduling. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes Sentinel, a proactive anomaly detection-based scheduling framework. Sentinel models the scheduling process as a two-stage Pre-Post-Scheduling paradigm: in the pre-scheduling stage, Sentinel conducts anomaly detection and constructs a strategy pool; in the post-scheduling stage, upon request arrival, it triggers an appropriate scheduling based on a pre-generated strategy to implement the scheduling process. Extensive experiments on realistic datasets show that Sentinel significantly reduces anomaly frequency by 70%, improves revenue by 74%, and doubles the scheduling speed.

**Justification:** The paper addresses a relevant and growing problem in live streaming â€“ efficient scheduling in dynamic, crowdsourced environments. The 'Pre-Post-Scheduling' paradigm with proactive anomaly detection seems like a reasonable approach to tackle instability. While the concept isn't entirely groundbreaking, the combination of anomaly detection *with* scheduling optimization is a solid contribution. The abstract suggests a well-structured approach, and the problem's practical relevance is high.
