## Abstract

arXiv:2505.23105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When accelerators fail in modern ML datacenters, operators migrate the affected ML training or inference jobs to entirely new racks. This approach, while preserving network performance, is highly inefficient, requiring datacenters to reserve full racks of idle accelerators for fault tolerance. In this paper, we address this resource inefficiency by introducing LUMION, a novel reconfigurable optical fabric for connecting accelerators within a datacenter rack. Instead of migrating entire ML jobs, LUMION dynamically integrates spare accelerators into ongoing workloads as failures occur, thereby maintaining consistent performance without costly migrations. We show the benefits of LUMION by building an end-to-end hardware prototype. Our experiments fine-tune Llama 3.2 and show that LUMION swaps a failed GPU with a healthy one and restarts the ML job within ~ 1 second of the failure. LUMION achieves higher inter-GPU bandwidth compared to traditional electrical racks after replacing failed accelerators with spare ones, leading to nearly 2X improvement in fine-tuning throughput.

**Sentiment Score:** 80.0/100

**Justification:** This paper addresses a significant problem in ML datacenter efficiency â€“ the high cost of rack-level fault tolerance. The proposed LUMION system, utilizing reconfigurable optical fabrics, offers a compelling alternative to full job migration, demonstrating a fast recovery time (~1 second). The prototype build and Llama 3.2 fine-tuning results add credibility, though more extensive evaluation across diverse workloads would strengthen the findings. The approach is novel and has the potential to reduce datacenter costs and improve ML job stability.
