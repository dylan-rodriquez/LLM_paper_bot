## Abstract

arXiv:2506.05209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on enormous quantities of unlicensed text, a practice that has led to scrutiny due to possible intellectual property infringement and ethical concerns. Training LLMs on openly licensed text presents a first step towards addressing these issues, but prior data collection efforts have yielded datasets too small or low-quality to produce performant LLMs. To address this gap, we collect, curate, and release the Common Pile v0.1, an eight terabyte collection of openly licensed text designed for LLM pretraining. The Common Pile comprises content from 30 sources that span diverse domains including research papers, code, books, encyclopedias, educational materials, audio transcripts, and more. Crucially, we validate our efforts by training two 7 billion parameter LLMs on text from the Common Pile: Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T, trained on 1 and 2 trillion tokens respectively. Both models attain competitive performance to LLMs trained on unlicensed text with similar computational budgets, such as Llama 1 and 2 7B. In addition to releasing the Common Pile v0.1 itself, we also release the code used in its creation as well as the training mixture and checkpoints for the Comma v0.1 models.

## Analysis

**Innovation Score:** 75.0/100
**Impact Score:** 88.0/100  
**Sentiment Score:** 90.0/100

**Justification:** This paper addresses a crucial issue in LLM development â€“ the ethical and legal concerns surrounding training data. The creation of a large, openly licensed dataset like the Common Pile is a significant undertaking and the validation through training and releasing models demonstrates a strong methodology. While the dataset creation itself isn't entirely novel, the scale and focus on open licensing are important advancements, and the positive sentiment is likely due to the community need for such resources.
