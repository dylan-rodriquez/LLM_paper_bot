## Abstract

arXiv:2505.23017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting (PTSF) plays a crucial role in decision-making across various fields, including economics, energy, and transportation. Most existing methods excell at short-term forecasting, while overlooking the hurdles of Long-term Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting (LPTSF). As the forecast horizon extends, the inherent nonlinear dynamics have a significant adverse effect on prediction accuracy, and make generative models inefficient by increasing the cost of each iteration. To overcome these limitations, we introduce $K^2$VAE, an efficient VAE-based generative model that leverages a KoopmanNet to transform nonlinear time series into a linear dynamical system, and devises a KalmanNet to refine predictions and model uncertainty in such linear system, which reduces error accumulation in long-term forecasting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $K^2$VAE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both short- and long-term PTSF, providing a more efficient and accurate solution.

**Justification:** The paper addresses a significant challenge in time series forecasting – long-term prediction – and proposes a novel combination of Koopman networks and Kalman filters within a VAE framework. The approach seems well-motivated and potentially effective in mitigating error accumulation. While the abstract doesn't detail the implementation specifics, the combination of techniques suggests a solid methodological foundation, and the claim of outperforming state-of-the-art methods is promising. The focus on probabilistic forecasting is also a strong point.
