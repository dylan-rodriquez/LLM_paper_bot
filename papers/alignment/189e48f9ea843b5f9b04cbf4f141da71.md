## Abstract

arXiv:2505.22984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The popular K-means clustering algorithm potentially suffers from a major weakness for further analysis or interpretation. Some cluster may have disproportionately more (or fewer) points from one of the subpopulations in terms of some sensitive variable, e.g., gender or race. Such a fairness issue may cause bias and unexpected social consequences. This work attempts to improve the fairness of K-means clustering with a two-stage optimization formulation--clustering first and then adjust cluster membership of a small subset of selected data points. Two computationally efficient algorithms are proposed in identifying those data points that are expensive for fairness, with one focusing on nearest data points outside of a cluster and the other on highly 'mixed' data points. Experiments on benchmark datasets show substantial improvement on fairness with a minimal impact to clustering quality. The proposed algorithms can be easily extended to a broad class of clustering algorithms or fairness metrics.

**Justification:** The paper addresses a crucial issue of fairness in K-means, which is increasingly important given the ethical concerns surrounding algorithmic bias. The two-stage optimization approach and computationally efficient algorithms for point selection seem well-motivated. While the approach isn't radically new, it offers a practical solution with a good balance between fairness and clustering quality, suggesting a solid contribution to the field. The mention of easy extensibility is also a positive sign.
