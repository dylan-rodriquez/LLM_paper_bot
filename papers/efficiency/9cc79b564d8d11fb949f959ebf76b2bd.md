## Abstract

arXiv:2505.23383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling propagation is the cornerstone for designing and optimizing next-generation wireless systems, with a particular emphasis on 5G and beyond era. Traditional modeling methods have long relied on statistic-based techniques to characterize propagation behavior across different environments. With the expansion of wireless communication systems, there is a growing demand for methods that guarantee the accuracy and interoperability of modeling. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques, in particular, are increasingly being adopted to overcome this challenge, although the interpretability is not assured with most of these methods. Inspired by recent advancements in AI, this paper proposes a novel approach that accelerates the discovery of path loss models while maintaining interpretability. The proposed method automates the model formulation, evaluation, and refinement, facilitating model discovery. We evaluate two techniques: one based on Deep Symbolic Regression, offering full interpretability, and the second based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, providing two levels of interpretability. Both approaches are evaluated on two synthetic and two real-world datasets. Our results show that Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks achieve R^2 values close to 1 with minimal prediction error, while Deep Symbolic Regression generates compact models with moderate accuracy. Moreover, on the selected examples, we demonstrate that automated methods outperform traditional methods, achieving up to 75% reduction in prediction errors, offering accurate and explainable solutions with potential to increase the efficiency of discovering next-generation path loss models.

## Analysis

**Innovation Score:** 70.0/100
**Impact Score:** 80.0/100  
**Sentiment Score:** 80.0/100

**Justification:** The paper addresses a crucial problem in wireless communication – accurate and interoperable path loss modeling – and leverages AI, a current trend. The focus on interpretability alongside automation is a strong point. While the abstract is brief, the stated goal of automating model discovery and evaluation suggests a solid methodology, though the specific techniques ('two techniques: one b...') are not detailed enough for a higher quality score. The potential impact on 5G/6G network design is significant.
