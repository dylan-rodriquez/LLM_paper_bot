## Abstract

arXiv:2505.22973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models represent the state-of-the-art for solving inverse problems such as image restoration tasks. In the Bayesian framework, diffusion-based inverse solvers incorporate a likelihood term to guide the prior sampling process, generating data consistent with the posterior distribution. However, due to the intractability of the likelihood term, many current methods rely on isotropic Gaussian approximations, which lead to deviations from the data manifold and result in inconsistent, unstable reconstructions. We propose Equivariance Regularized (EquiReg) diffusion, a general framework for regularizing posterior sampling in diffusion-based inverse problem solvers. EquiReg enhances reconstructions by reweighting diffusion trajectories and penalizing those that deviate from the data manifold. We define a new distribution-dependent equivariance error, empirically identify functions that exhibit low error for on-manifold samples and higher error for off-manifold samples, and leverage these functions to regularize the diffusion sampling process. When applied to a variety of solvers, EquiReg outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion models in both linear and nonlinear image restoration tasks, as well as in reconstructing partial differential equations.

**Justification:** The paper addresses a significant issue in diffusion-based inverse problem solving â€“ the reliance on isotropic Gaussian approximations and resulting instability. The proposed EquiReg framework appears to be a well-motivated approach to regularizing posterior sampling, and the mention of an equivariance error and empirical identification of suitable functions suggests a rigorous methodology. While the abstract doesn't detail the specifics of the error function or reweighting scheme, the overall concept is promising and aligns with current research trends in improving diffusion model robustness.
