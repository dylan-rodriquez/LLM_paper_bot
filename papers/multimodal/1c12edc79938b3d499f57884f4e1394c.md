## Abstract

arXiv:2505.23334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the transformative impact of deep learning on text, audio, and image datasets, its dominance in tabular data, especially in the medical domain where data are often scarce, remains less clear. In this paper, we propose X2Graph, a novel deep learning method that achieves strong performance on small biological tabular datasets. X2Graph leverages external knowledge about the relationships between table columns, such as gene interactions, to convert each sample into a graph structure. This transformation enables the application of standard message passing algorithms for graph modeling. Our X2Graph method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing tree-based and deep learning methods across three cancer subtyping datasets.

**Innovation Score:** 72.0/100
**Impact Score:** 75.0/100  
**Sentiment Score:** 80.0/100

**Justification:** The paper addresses a relevant problem â€“ applying deep learning to small, tabular biological datasets, a common scenario in medical research. The approach of leveraging external knowledge to create graph structures is a novel way to adapt graph neural networks to tabular data. While the abstract doesn't detail the extent of the performance improvement, the claim of 'superior performance' suggests a worthwhile contribution, and the focus on cancer subtyping is impactful. The work appears well-motivated and likely to be received positively by the bioinformatics and machine learning communities.
