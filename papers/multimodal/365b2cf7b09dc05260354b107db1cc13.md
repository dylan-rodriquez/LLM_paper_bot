## Abstract

Abstract: Sentence stress refers to emphasis, placed on specific words within a spoken utterance to highlight or contrast an idea, or to introduce new information. It is often used to imply an underlying intention that is not explicitly stated. Recent advances in speech-aware language models (SLMs) have enabled direct processing of audio, allowing models to bypass transcription and access the full richness of the speech signal and perform audio reasoning tasks such as spoken question answering. Despite the crucial role of sentence stress in shaping meaning and speaker intent, it remains largely overlooked in evaluation and development of such models. In this work, we address this gap by introducing StressTest, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate a model's ability to distinguish between interpretations of spoken sentences based on the stress pattern. We assess the performance of several leading SLMs and find that, despite their overall capabilities, they perform poorly on such tasks. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel synthetic data generation pipeline, and create Stress17k, a training set that simulates change of meaning implied by stress variation. Then, we empirically show that optimizing models with this synthetic dataset aligns well with real-world recordings and enables effective finetuning of SLMs. Results suggest, that our finetuned model, StresSLM, significantly outperforms existing models on both sentence stress reasoning and detection tasks.

**Justification:** This paper addresses a crucial, yet often overlooked, aspect of speech understanding â€“ sentence stress. The creation of a dedicated benchmark (StressTest) is a strong methodological contribution, and the initial findings suggesting current SLMs struggle with this nuance are significant. While the core idea isn't entirely novel (understanding prosody is known to be important), focusing specifically on stress and creating a benchmark is a valuable step forward. The work appears well-motivated and clearly presented, suggesting a positive reception within the speech and NLP communities.
