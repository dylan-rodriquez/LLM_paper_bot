## Papers Added

## Applications (3 new papers)
- **IYKYK: Using language models to decode extremist cryptolects** (Score: 92.0)
  - This research tackles a highly relevant and important problem â€“ understanding extremist communication. The finding that general LLMs struggle with this task, but can be improved with adaptation, is valuable. The release of datasets is a significant contribution to the field, and the work appears methodologically sound based on the abstract. The innovation is moderate, building on existing LLM techniques rather than presenting entirely new architectures.
- **Interpretation Meets Safety: A Survey on Interpretation Methods and Tools for Improving LLM Safety** (Score: 92.0)
  - This survey addresses a highly relevant and timely problem â€“ LLM safety â€“ and uniquely focuses on the intersection of interpretation techniques and safety enhancements. The creation of a unified framework and novel taxonomy is a strong methodological contribution. While surveys are generally incremental, bridging this gap in existing literature is valuable, and the scope of nearly 70 works suggests a comprehensive effort.
- **SoK: Are Watermarks in LLMs Ready for Deployment?** (Score: 92.0)
  - This paper tackles a highly relevant and timely problem â€“ the security and intellectual property protection of LLMs. The 'Systematization of Knowledge' (SoK) approach, including a taxonomy and a novel classifier, suggests a rigorous and well-structured investigation. While the abstract doesn't detail the specifics of the classifier, the overall framing indicates a strong potential for impact and positive reception within the LLM security community.

## Training (1 new papers)
- **Hey, That's My Data! Label-Only Dataset Inference in Large Language Models** (Score: 92.0)
  - This paper tackles a very important and timely problem â€“ dataset inference in LLMs, especially as log probabilities become less accessible. The proposed CatShift framework, leveraging catastrophic forgetting, appears to be a novel approach to label-only inference. The potential for detecting unauthorized data usage is significant, and the clear framing of the problem suggests a strong understanding of the current landscape. While the abstract doesn't detail the specifics of the method, the concept is promising and well-motivated.

## Generation (1 new papers)
- **MIRIAD: Augmenting LLMs with millions of medical query-response pairs** (Score: 90.0)
  - This paper addresses a crucial problem in applying LLMs to healthcare: the accuracy of medical information. The creation of a large, curated QA dataset (MIRIAD) specifically designed for medical applications is a strong contribution. The semi-automated pipeline combining LLM generation with human annotation appears rigorous, and the focus on grounding in peer-reviewed literature is commendable. The potential for improving LLM performance in medical contexts is significant, suggesting a positive reception within the research community.

## Evaluation (1 new papers)
- **MMTU: A Massive Multi-Task Table Understanding and Reasoning Benchmark** (Score: 92.0)
  - This paper addresses a critical gap in LLM evaluation â€“ the lack of comprehensive benchmarks for table understanding and reasoning. The creation of MMTU with 30K questions across 25 tasks is a substantial undertaking and demonstrates a strong methodological approach. The focus on real-world tasks beyond NL-to-SQL is particularly valuable, suggesting a high likelihood of positive reception within the AI community.
