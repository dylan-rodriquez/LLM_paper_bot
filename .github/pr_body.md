## Papers Added

## Evaluation (3 new papers)
- **Nine Ways to Break Copyright Law and Why Our LLM Won't: A Fair Use Aligned Generation Framework** (Score: 92.0)
  - This paper tackles a crucial and timely problem â€“ copyright infringement in LLMs â€“ with a practical and legally-informed approach. The creation of FairUseDB and the application of DPO for alignment are strong methodological choices. While DPO isn't novel in itself, its application to this specific legal constraint is a valuable contribution, and the collaboration with IP experts adds significant weight to the work. The focus on *avoiding* infringement rather than simply filtering outputs is a promising direction.
- **MedHELM: Holistic Evaluation of Large Language Models for Medical Tasks** (Score: 92.0)
  - This paper addresses a crucial gap in LLM evaluation for the medical domain, moving beyond simplistic exam-based benchmarks. The clinician-validated taxonomy and comprehensive benchmark suite are strong methodological contributions. The systematic comparison of LLMs and cost-performance analysis add significant value, and the initial results showing performance variation are promising. The work is well-aligned with current trends in responsible AI and the need for robust evaluation of LLMs in high-stakes applications.
- **Large Language Models Often Know When They Are Being Evaluated** (Score: 90.0)
  - This research addresses a crucial and timely problem in the field of LLMs â€“ the potential for models to alter their behavior when they detect evaluation. The methodology appears sound, constructing a diverse benchmark and demonstrating above-random awareness in frontier models. While the human baseline is still higher, the findings raise serious concerns about the reliability of current evaluation methods and the need for more robust benchmarking strategies.

## Architectures (3 new papers)
- **Detection of Suicidal Risk on Social Media: A Hybrid Model** (Score: 92.0)
  - This research tackles a highly significant problem â€“ suicidal risk detection â€“ with a potentially useful hybrid approach. The combination of RoBERTa, TF-IDF, and PCA is a reasonable strategy to address the challenges of imbalanced data and improve model performance. While the hybrid model isn't radically new, the application to this specific problem and the focus on data resampling/augmentation techniques demonstrate a solid methodological approach. The potential for real-world impact is high, given the societal need for early detection tools.
- **Beyond Exponential Decay: Rethinking Error Accumulation in Large Language Models** (Score: 92.0)
  - This paper tackles a crucial problem in LLM research â€“ the limitations of sequence length â€“ and proposes a compelling alternative to the standard exponential decay model. The identification of 'key tokens' as the primary drivers of error is a novel and potentially impactful insight. The abstract suggests a rigorous approach with converging evidence, and the potential for targeted strategies to improve long-context performance is highly promising.
- **The State of Multilingual LLM Safety Research: From Measuring the Language Gap to Mitigating It** (Score: 90.0)
  - This paper addresses a crucial and timely issue in LLM safety â€“ the significant bias towards English language research. The systematic review methodology appears sound, and the identification of a language gap is a valuable contribution. While the paper primarily *highlights* a problem rather than presenting novel solutions, the proposed future directions are well-considered and likely to stimulate further research. The high relevance to current AI safety concerns suggests a positive reception within the community.

## Applications (1 new papers)
- **Revisiting Uncertainty Estimation and Calibration of Large Language Models** (Score: 90.0)
  - This paper addresses a crucial problem in LLM deployment â€“ uncertainty estimation â€“ with a comprehensive empirical study. The scale of the evaluation (80 models, diverse architectures and sizes) is impressive and the use of MMLU-Pro as a challenging benchmark strengthens the findings. While the methods evaluated (TPU, NVU, LVU) aren't entirely novel, the systematic comparison and identification of LVU as a consistently strong performer is valuable. The focus on calibration and selective classification is highly relevant for real-world applications.

## Training (1 new papers)
- **ScienceMeter: Tracking Scientific Knowledge Updates in Language Models** (Score: 90.0)
  - This paper addresses a crucial problem in the age of LLMs â€“ their rapidly decaying scientific knowledge. The proposed ScienceMeter framework, with its three distinct metrics (preservation, acquisition, projection), offers a comprehensive and well-defined approach to evaluating knowledge update methods. The scale of the dataset (15,444 papers, 30,888 claims) suggests a rigorous evaluation, and the focus on ten domains adds breadth. The high sentiment score reflects the current research community's strong interest in addressing LLM knowledge limitations.
