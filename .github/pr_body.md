## Papers Added

## Training (3 new papers)
- **Can We Infer Confidential Properties of Training Data from LLMs?** (Score: 92.0)
  - This paper addresses a highly relevant and timely problem â€“ the potential for LLMs to leak confidential information from their training data. The introduction of PropInfer as a benchmark and the proposal of tailored attacks are strong methodological contributions. While the attacks themselves may build on existing property inference techniques, adapting them to the LLM context is novel and important, and the focus on both question-answering and chat-completion paradigms adds to the work's value.
- **Unsupervised Elicitation of Language Models** (Score: 90.0)
  - This paper addresses a crucial bottleneck in scaling language models â€“ the difficulty of obtaining high-quality human supervision, especially for highly capable models. The proposed 'Internal Coherence Maximization' (ICM) method is a novel approach to fine-tuning LMs without external labels, and the reported results, matching or exceeding human-supervised training, are compelling. The ability to elicit superhuman capabilities is particularly noteworthy, suggesting a significant advancement in LM training paradigms. The positive results on frontier LMs further strengthen the paper's potential.
- **Provably Learning from Language Feedback** (Score: 90.0)
  - This paper tackles a crucial problem in the rapidly evolving field of LLM agents â€“ formalizing and understanding learning from language feedback. The introduction of 'transfer eluder dimension' as a complexity measure is a novel approach, and the claim of exponential speedups over reward-based learning is significant. The development of a provably no-regret algorithm, HELIX, further strengthens the work, suggesting a high degree of rigor and potential for practical application.

## Multimodal (2 new papers)
- **Multimodal Large Language Models: A Survey** (Score: 92.0)
  - This survey paper addresses a highly relevant and rapidly evolving field â€“ Multimodal Large Language Models. The categorization of generative modalities and analysis of foundational techniques (SSL, MoE, RLHF, CoT) provides a valuable overview for researchers. While the abstract doesn't detail novel *methods*, the comprehensive scope and synthesis of existing work suggest high quality and potential impact, and the field is currently experiencing significant interest.
- **IndoToxic2024: A Demographically-Enriched Dataset of Hate Speech and Toxicity Types for Indonesian Language** (Score: 92.0)
  - This paper addresses a critical and timely problem â€“ the rise of online hate speech in Indonesia, particularly targeting vulnerable groups. The creation of a large, demographically-enriched dataset is a significant contribution, especially given the lack of resources for Indonesian language hate speech detection. While the dataset creation itself isn't groundbreaking in methodology, the focus on specific marginalized groups and the timing around a major political event adds value. The potential for real-world impact is high, and the community is likely to receive this work positively.

## Evaluation (2 new papers)
- **Disclosure Audits for LLM Agents** (Score: 92.0)
  - This paper addresses a highly relevant and timely problem â€“ the privacy risks associated with increasingly capable LLM agents. The proposed CMPL framework appears well-motivated and designed to overcome limitations of single-turn auditing methods. The focus on multi-turn interactions and systematic vulnerability uncovering is a strong point, suggesting a rigorous approach. The potential for revealing risks not caught by existing defenses is significant, indicating a positive reception within the community.
- **Breaking Bad Molecules: Are MLLMs Ready for Structure-Level Molecular Detoxification?** (Score: 92.0)
  - This paper addresses a crucial bottleneck in drug discovery â€“ molecular toxicity repair â€“ and does so by systematically defining and benchmarking the problem for MLLMs. The creation of ToxiMol and ToxiEval represents a significant contribution to the field, providing standardized tools for evaluating model performance. The focus on mechanism-aware prompting and integration of multiple evaluation metrics (toxicity, accessibility, drug-likeness) demonstrates a rigorous and thoughtful approach.

## Applications (1 new papers)
- **Time-IMM: A Dataset and Benchmark for Irregular Multimodal Multivariate Time Series** (Score: 92.0)
  - This paper addresses a crucial gap in time series research by focusing on the realistic complexities of real-world data â€“ irregularity, multimodality, and missingness. The creation of Time-IMM and IMM-TSF is a valuable contribution, providing a much-needed benchmark for evaluating models in more challenging scenarios. While the core idea of a benchmark isn't entirely novel, the specific focus on *cause-driven* irregularity and the inclusion of specialized fusion modules demonstrate a thoughtful approach.

## Reasoning (1 new papers)
- **Robustly Improving LLM Fairness in Realistic Settings via Interpretability** (Score: 92.0)
  - This paper tackles a crucial problem â€“ the failure of simple debiasing techniques in realistic LLM deployment scenarios. The focus on internal bias mitigation via activation manipulation is a promising approach, and the evaluation across multiple leading models is strong. While the core idea of identifying and neutralizing sensitive attribute directions isn't entirely novel, the demonstration of its robustness in complex contexts is significant. The findings suggest current mitigation strategies are insufficient, highlighting the need for more sophisticated techniques.

## Alignment (1 new papers)
- **Weak-to-Strong Jailbreaking on Large Language Models** (Score: 92.0)
  - This paper addresses a critical safety concern in LLMs â€“ jailbreaking â€“ with a novel and efficient approach. The 'weak-to-strong' attack leveraging smaller models to manipulate larger ones is a clever idea, and achieving >99% misalignment on some datasets is a strong result. The clarity of the abstract suggests a well-written paper, and the focus on practical efficiency is valuable.
