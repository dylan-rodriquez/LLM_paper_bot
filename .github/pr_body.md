## Papers Added

## Training (3 new papers)
- **Towards LLM-Centric Multimodal Fusion: A Survey on Integration Strategies and Techniques** (Score: 92.0)
  - This survey paper addresses a highly relevant and rapidly evolving field â€“ multimodal LLMs. The LLM-centric approach and proposed classification framework (architectural strategies, representation learning, training paradigms) offer a valuable organization of the current landscape. While the survey itself doesn't present novel *methods*, its systematic analysis and categorization are crucial for researchers navigating this complex area, and the inclusion of 125 papers suggests a comprehensive scope.
- **Just a Scratch: Enhancing LLM Capabilities for Self-harm Detection through Intent Differentiation and Emoji Interpretation** (Score: 92.0)
  - This research tackles a critically important problem â€“ self-harm detection â€“ with a novel approach focusing on emoji interpretation and intent differentiation. The creation of the CESM-100 and SHINES datasets are valuable contributions to the field, and the multi-task learning framework appears well-reasoned. While the abstract doesn't detail the specific LLM architectures used or performance gains, the overall approach seems promising and well-suited to address the challenges of subtle self-harm expressions.
- **The Common Pile v0.1: An 8TB Dataset of Public Domain and Openly Licensed Text** (Score: 92.0)
  - This paper addresses a crucial issue in LLM development â€“ the ethical and legal concerns surrounding training data. The creation of a large, openly licensed dataset like the Common Pile is a significant undertaking and the validation through training and releasing models demonstrates a strong methodology. While the dataset creation itself isn't entirely novel, the scale and focus on open licensing are important advancements, and the positive sentiment is likely due to the community need for such resources.

## Alignment (1 new papers)
- **Flattery, Fluff, and Fog: Diagnosing and Mitigating Idiosyncratic Biases in Preference Models** (Score: 90.0)
  - This paper tackles a crucial problem in LLM alignment â€“ the susceptibility of preference models to superficial features. The systematic investigation using controlled counterfactuals and quantification of bias skew and miscalibration are strong methodological points. The findings, with >60% skew and ~40% miscalibration, are significant and suggest a widespread issue needing attention. The work is well-defined and addresses a timely concern in the field.
