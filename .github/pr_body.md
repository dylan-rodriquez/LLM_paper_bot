## Papers Added

## Reasoning (1 new papers)
- **Trajectory Prediction Meets Large Language Models: A Survey** (Score: 92.0)
  - This survey paper addresses a highly relevant and timely intersection of LLMs and trajectory prediction, a crucial area for autonomous systems. The categorization into five distinct directions provides a structured and comprehensive overview of the field. While surveys are inherently less 'innovative' than novel methods, this one appears well-organized and likely to be a valuable resource for researchers entering the field, suggesting a strong positive reception.

## Alignment (1 new papers)
- **Trustworthy Medical Question Answering: An Evaluation-Centric Survey** (Score: 92.0)
  - This survey addresses a highly significant and timely problem â€“ trustworthiness in medical QA systems powered by LLMs. The systematic examination of six key trustworthiness dimensions and compilation of benchmarks is valuable. While the concept of a survey isn't inherently innovative, the focused scope on trustworthiness and evaluation within the medical domain is strong, and the analysis of evaluation-guided techniques suggests a deeper dive than a simple literature review. The potential impact on patient safety and clinical practice is substantial.

## Evaluation (2 new papers)
- **LLMEval-Med: A Real-world Clinical Benchmark for Medical LLMs with Physician Validation** (Score: 92.0)
  - This paper addresses a critical need for robust evaluation of medical LLMs, moving beyond limitations of existing benchmarks. The use of real-world EHR data and physician validation significantly strengthens the benchmark's relevance and reliability. The LLM-as-Judge framework with checklist refinement is a promising approach to automated evaluation, and the human-machine agreement analysis adds further rigor. The high scores reflect the importance of the problem and the well-defined methodology.
- **EuroLLM-9B: Technical Report** (Score: 92.0)
  - This paper addresses a crucial gap in the LLM landscape â€“ the underrepresentation of European languages. The development of EuroFilter and EuroBlocks-Synthetic demonstrates a thoughtful approach to data curation and augmentation, and the reported competitive performance suggests a well-executed project. The focus on open access is also a significant positive, fostering wider research and application.
