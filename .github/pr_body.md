## Papers Added

## Alignment (1 new papers)
- **Unintended Harms of Value-Aligned LLMs: Psychological and Empirical Insights** (Score: 92.0)
  - This paper addresses a crucial and timely safety concern regarding value-aligned LLMs, which is becoming increasingly important as personalization gains traction. The identification of a correlation between value alignment and *increased* harmful behavior, rather than decreased, is a counterintuitive and significant finding. The use of a detailed safety category dataset strengthens the empirical basis of the research, and the psychological framing adds depth. While the abstract doesn't detail the specific methods, the initial findings suggest a robust investigation.

## Architectures (1 new papers)
- **A Survey of Retentive Network** (Score: 90.0)
  - The abstract clearly articulates a significant problem â€“ the limitations of Transformers with long sequences â€“ and proposes a novel solution, RetNet, that addresses these limitations. The reported cross-domain effectiveness suggests a robust and well-developed approach. While the abstract doesn't detail the specifics of the retention mechanism, the claims of linear-time inference and parallelizable training are compelling, indicating a high-quality contribution.

## Reasoning (1 new papers)
- **PCoT: Persuasion-Augmented Chain of Thought for Detecting Fake News and Social Media Disinformation** (Score: 90.0)
  - This paper addresses a highly significant problem â€“ disinformation detection â€“ and proposes a novel approach (PCoT) grounded in psychological principles. The creation and release of two new, up-to-date datasets (EUDisinfo and MultiDis) is a substantial contribution, particularly given the rapidly evolving nature of online disinformation. While the core idea of leveraging persuasion knowledge is promising, the 15% performance improvement, while notable, needs further scrutiny in the full paper to assess its statistical significance and robustness.

## Training (3 new papers)
- **Adversarial Paraphrasing: A Universal Attack for Humanizing AI-Generated Text** (Score: 92.0)
  - This research addresses a highly relevant and timely problem â€“ the vulnerability of AI text detectors to evasion. The 'Adversarial Paraphrasing' framework, leveraging an LLM guided by a detector, appears to be a novel and effective approach to bypassing detection. The claim of universality and transferability across detection systems is particularly strong, suggesting a significant contribution to understanding and mitigating risks associated with AI-generated content.
- **Right Is Not Enough: The Pitfalls of Outcome Supervision in Training LLMs for Math Reasoning** (Score: 90.0)
  - This paper tackles a crucial problem in LLM development â€“ the disconnect between correct answers and sound reasoning. The introduction of MathOlympiadEval and ParaStepVerifier appears to be a strong methodological contribution, addressing the limitations of existing evaluation techniques. The focus on step-by-step verification is particularly valuable, and the initial results suggest a significant improvement in identifying flawed reasoning, making it likely to be well-received by the community.
- **RULE: Reinforcement UnLEarning Achieves Forget-Retain Pareto Optimality** (Score: 90.0)
  - This paper tackles a very important and timely problem â€“ unlearning in LLMs â€“ and proposes a novel approach using reinforcement learning to optimize refusal boundaries. The focus on efficiency (small forget set) and avoiding utility loss is commendable. While the abstract doesn't detail the specifics of the reward function verification, the overall framing suggests a rigorous methodology and potential for significant impact.

## Knowledge (1 new papers)
- **ConfQA: Answer Only If You Are Confident** (Score: 90.0)
  - This paper addresses the critical problem of hallucination in LLMs, a major barrier to their reliable deployment. The ConfQA strategy, particularly the 'answer only if confident' prompt and leveraging knowledge graph attributes, appears to be a significant improvement over existing methods, achieving a substantial reduction in hallucination rates. The mention of a 'Dual Neural Knowledge framework' suggests further development and potential for broader applicability, indicating a strong likelihood of positive reception within the community.
