## Papers Added

## Training (1 new papers)
- **Truth over Tricks: Measuring and Mitigating Shortcut Learning in Misinformation Detection** (Score: 92.0)
  - This paper tackles a crucial problem in misinformation detection â€“ the reliance on superficial shortcuts by models, especially LLMs. The introduction of 'TruthOverTricks' as a unified evaluation paradigm is a strong methodological contribution, and the creation of new datasets adds to its value. The focus on both intrinsic and extrinsic shortcut learning provides a nuanced understanding of the issue, suggesting a high potential for influencing future research and development in this area.

## Evaluation (1 new papers)
- **FlowerTune: A Cross-Domain Benchmark for Federated Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models** (Score: 90.0)
  - This paper addresses a highly relevant and timely problem â€“ federated learning for LLMs â€“ which is crucial for addressing data privacy and access limitations. The creation of a cross-domain benchmark (FlowerTune) is a significant contribution, providing a standardized way to evaluate LLM performance in FL settings. While FL itself isn't new, applying it specifically to LLMs and creating a comprehensive benchmark demonstrates strong potential for impact and positive community reception.
