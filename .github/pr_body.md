- **DINGO: Constrained Inference for Diffusion LLMs** (Score: 80.0)
  - This paper addresses a crucial limitation of diffusion LLMs â€“ the inability to enforce constraints â€“ which hinders their use in practical applications requiring structured outputs. The proposed DINGO approach, leveraging dynamic programming, appears to be a novel and effective solution for constrained decoding in this context. The claim of distribution preservation is particularly strong, and the problem is well-motivated, suggesting a positive reception from the community.
