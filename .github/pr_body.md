## Papers Added

## Evaluation (2 new papers)
- **CounselBench: A Large-Scale Expert Evaluation and Adversarial Benchmark of Large Language Models in Mental Health Counseling** (Score: 92.0)
  - This paper addresses a highly significant and timely problem â€“ the safe and effective use of LLMs in mental health. The creation of CounselBench, with expert evaluations and adversarial testing, is a strong methodological contribution. The finding that LLMs can *outperform* human therapists in perceived quality while simultaneously raising safety concerns is particularly noteworthy and suggests a nuanced evaluation is crucial. The identification of LLM judges overrating responses is also a valuable insight.
- **AdversariaL attacK sAfety aLIgnment(ALKALI): Safeguarding LLMs through GRACE: Geometric Representation-Aware Contrastive Enhancement- Introducing Adversarial Vulnerability Quality Index (AVQI)** (Score: 92.0)
  - This paper tackles a crucial and timely problem in LLM safety â€“ the vulnerability to adversarial attacks exploiting latent geometric weaknesses. The introduction of ALKALI, a large-scale benchmark, and the concept of 'latent camouflage' are strong contributions. While GRACE is presented as a mitigation, the abstract doesn't detail its mechanics enough for a full quality assessment, but the problem framing and benchmark creation are exceptionally well done. The high scores reflect the importance of the issue and the potential for significant impact.

## Training (2 new papers)
- **GradEscape: A Gradient-Based Evader Against AI-Generated Text Detectors** (Score: 92.0)
  - This paper tackles a very important and timely problem â€“ the arms race between AI-generated text and its detection. The proposed GradEscape method appears novel in its gradient-based approach to evading detectors, particularly addressing the discrete nature of text. The evaluation against state-of-the-art methods and across multiple models suggests a rigorous approach, and the handling of tokenizer mismatch is a significant practical consideration. The potential for misuse is high, but understanding these vulnerabilities is crucial for developing more robust detection methods.
- **A Survey on Large Language Models for Mathematical Reasoning** (Score: 92.0)
  - This survey paper addresses a highly significant and timely topic â€“ the application of LLMs to mathematical reasoning. The categorization into comprehension and answer generation phases provides a useful framework for understanding the field's progress. While the abstract doesn't detail novel *methods*, a comprehensive survey of existing techniques (prompting, fine-tuning, CoT) is valuable, and the mention of 'test-time scaling' suggests awareness of current research directions. The identified challenges (capacity, efficiency, generalization) are crucial for future work.
